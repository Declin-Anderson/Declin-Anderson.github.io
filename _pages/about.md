I'm a graduate from University of Wisconsin - Stout!

My major was Computer Science with a concentration on Game Design and Development and I have a minor in Mathematics.

I'm currently working for start up that I helped found called Totally Not a Bunch of Cats LLC where we produce video games with currently one released mobile game and another on the way. Aiming to work on a computer game after our next release.

I interested in all things video games with a history of front-end design and development but I love learning every aspect of game design and development and love to share my experience and work with everyone!

# Selected Experience

## Front-end Design and Development

My experience with Front-end Design and Development for started with [Oddities and Commodities](https://tscgalaxy.itch.io/oddities-commodities), a project made in Unity as a team of 4 in 5 months, that I drew out the general layout of the menu and flow, as well as creating an dynamic inventory system. I also came up the game idea!

My first major experience was with [Grave Robber of London](https://g4974.gitlab.io/graverobberatlarge/), a project made in Unity as a team of 15 in 10 months, where I coordinated with our artists to layout the menu design then build the backend of our menus and inventory system!

This all calesce to my most recent experience was with [Corralling Cats](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TotallyNotaBunchofCats.HerdingCats&hl=en_US), my first project with Totally Not a Bunch of Cats LLC, where I got bring my history of Front-end development to my first mobile release!

## Post College Learning journey

One of the most important things to me after I finished my education at University of Wisconsin - Stout was to continue my education and learning. In the tech world there is always new things to learn and old practices to prefect, and so I've made sure to continue feeding my ravenous mind new things! One of the biggest help in this has been GameDev.tv which has wonderful tutorials for all Engines used in the Video Game Industry.

While most of my programming journey has been in Unity Engine for video game development, I have also dabbled in learning Godot using GDScript as my language, as well as learning the power of both blueprints in Unreal and C++ scripting.

You can see some of these projects under my Portfolio Tab!
