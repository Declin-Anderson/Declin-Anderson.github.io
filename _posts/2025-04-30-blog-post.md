Welcome to my first blog post! My name is Declin Anderson and I have mostly done UI in Unity when it has come to projects that I work on, and so I wanted to learn different sides of Unity! I had a good game idea for a doomlike game and so that is what the first project I will be working on in these blogs! When it comes to what I wanted to implement at the start of this project, I wanted the character to be able to move around the environment and for them to explore a randomly generate map layout. So, to kick off this journey I started by tackling the First-Person Controller.

FPS Controller:
======
I have some experience with creating camera movement and player movement but not with a first-person point of view. In the past I have worked with creating camera movement for isometric point of views, so I was familiar with how you want to handle camera positioning and movement, so it was a matter of knowing the position of the player and placing the camera in that area. As for handling inputs for the player movement I wanted to learn how the input action map works as I have typically just done Input Managers and so I went about learning this.

I first created my input action map and created the actions using vectors and buttons for corresponding inputs, then I used the auto generate C# class for the input so that I could read the inputs in my Player Controller Script. Then in my player controller script I made a different variable for different player settings like speed, jump height, and the input for player movement, I then got the context of the player actions to use for the different player inputs, right now that’s just movement, jumping, and looking around. I then built functions for what is used by inputs to apply motion to the player whether that is moving along the floor or jumping and reading mouse input or right stick on the controller to look about. Through these I was able to get a first person POV working and now I could explore the map.

Room Generation Outline
======
So, when deciding what I wanted to do for level generation I had the choice of choosing either scripted levels or random generated levels. I originally started by creating a little explorable town to make sure my FPS Controller was working so I create some prefab building and placed them around the zone. As I was doing this, I felt like I wanted to learn more about how you would create a randomly generated level then to build my own, so I switched. For my random generated dungeon, I wanted to use rooms that built to fill the dungeon and I wanted it to create a random pathway that would close off. So, I went about doing that!

Room Generation Implementation
======
So, to start I built the prefab rooms that would be used to build the dungeon! I started with a start room that has only 1 exit that is where the generation will start from, then from there I built the set of rooms that would allow for different pathways, such as a 4-way room, a corner room, or an end piece. Once I had all the prefabs built, I add colliders to the doorways and give them rigidbodies so when I placed rooms, they would trigger the colliders if they were to collide with the walls of rooms. After all these room prefabs were setup, it was on to making the rooms generate!

So, the way I wanted to go about it was that a random doorway of all available doorways would be selected to try to add a room to then you apply transformation to the room to line it up. So first, I instantiate a temp room from the list of prefabs I have built, so it might be a four way, or it could be an end cap, then I rotate the room so that the doorway lines up with what door it’s going to attach to, then I figure out the position in the world that room will go to. After getting this measurement, I then create the actual room being added from these measurements because I was having problems with the collision detection on the prefab when moving it to the end location so instead, I create a room in the end goal spot. I then continue this until I have a dungeon with several rooms equal to the max I want or its naturally has closed off itself.

I did run into a couple problems while doing this! First, I had rooms spawning on top of each other which was because I had to fix the z of my doorways, so it pointed out of the room as initially I just had the objects set up so that they were in the right place, but I hadn't rotated along the y so that the z axis pointed out of the door which fixed that problem.

My other problem was room was spawning on top of each other which I believe was because collision wasn't being detected well when moving the room from the origin to the target goal, so I instead use the first room to get measurements then spawn a room at the targeted location!

What’s Next?
======
My next goal in this project is add corridors between rooms since it would the dungeon feel more nice and easier to see how the room connect for debugging purposes. I also want to add enemies that can use nav meshes in the rooms so that they attack me when I enter the room!
