Corralling Cats will be my first mobile game launch that worked on and will be coming to IOS and android at the start of Summer 2023! Made in Unity, Corralling Cats is exactly what you think it is about, you are trying to herd cats! You get your cats into their pens through toys that you can place and traps on the map that help to move them around the map, with your goal being to get them into the pens in as few moves as possible. Made as a passion project, our goal was to learn about how deployment to Appstore work and to form the LLC of Totally not a Bunch of Cats to monetize our game!

As a programmer, I am currently working on our dynamic level select so that as we create levels for our game so when we are finish with levels, they can be added to the game manager and the level select will automatically update to fit the new level accordingly. I also worked on the current UI for the game which we plan on updating as we get new assets from our artist, and lastly, I have helped to design some of the levels in our game!
