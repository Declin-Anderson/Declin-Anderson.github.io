Grave Robber of London was my first full game launch that I made in Unity! Grave Robber of London is about a Resurrectionist in Pre-Victorian London that out of spite of their Master shunning them, decides to become the best graverobber alive by stealing the Queen's corpse from her royal tomb! You reach the point of raiding the tomb by sneaking around graveyards, avoiding the guards and traps laid, then selling the bodies collected to upgrade your tools and eventually paying for the secret way to the tomb.

Grave Robber of London was made in Unity as a team of 15, 6 programmers, 5 artist, and 4 sound designers. Our 4 sound designers were from Berklee College of Music and provided the sound effects and music for our game using FMOD. I was a programmer for the project as well as I storyboarded our game and managed the scope so that we didn't focus on features that weren't necessary for the game. My primary focus as a programmer for the game was working on the Front-end implementation and working as a jack of all trades.

As a programmer, I created the dynamic inventory system that we used to store the corpses so that, it displayed the image of the corpse as well as the value it and the ability to delete the user wanted to remove a corpse from their inventory. I also set up the camera movement and angle using LERP to create a fluid movement and to make the navigation of the cemeteryâ€™s user friendly. Lastly, I did the initial designs of the User Interface for the artists to build from, and later the implementation of the User Interfaces that player would use in navigating their items as well as the shops!

As for the storyboarding I mocked up the general flow of the menus for the game and how the player would navigate between our scenes. I drew visuals for the storyboard to show the team how the User Interface would be setup between scenes and what scenes could lead to which scenes. I also took on the role of scope manager halfway through the project for as our timeline came closer to the deadline, we needed to make decisions on what to cut and I was the deciding factor on non-essentials features.
