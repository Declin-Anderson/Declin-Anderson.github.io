Oddities & Commodities was my first game that I worked on in Unity! Oddities & Commodities is about a shop keeper that dabbles in the eldritch and occult dealings. In the game you use henchmen to fetch your rare relics that you then barter with customers to make money, and the objective is to go for as long as possible!

Made as a team of 4, 3 programmers and 1 artist, Oddities and Commodities was my brainchild, so I took creative lead, and I was programmer for the team! As a programmer, I created the dynamic inventory system that we use to store the relics as well as the tooltip displayed for them. I also created the shop layout and imported the assets in to make the shop in game! While as the creative lead I took lead of our discussions as a team to help guide towards what features we could implement and the thematic elements that would best cover the feelings.

As this project was done in a couple of months, there was plenty of work that still could have been done to polish the features in game, as well as there was plenty of features that weren't necessary to create our MVP but would have helped to build the atmosphere and improve the gameplay. Ideally, we would of eventually of added a day/night cycle to allow a player to reflect on their earnings and to adjust the economy with the idea of supply and demand. Also, we wanted to create an employee lounge to allow the player to interact with their henchmen, helping the player to feel more engrossed in the world. Lastly, would have been a sanity tracker as you are dealing with objects beyond your comprehension so would have played with that idea!
